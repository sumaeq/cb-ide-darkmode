# Dark mode userscript for Chaturbate's new App IDE
A very silly dark mode userscript for Chaturbate's new app IDE.
Use with [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or any compatible userscript manager.
This script just adds a bunch of CSS filters to invert the whole page,
and a bunch of others to fix images and fine-tune syntax highlighting.

### ⚠️ Known issues and drawbacks
- Emojis look a little weird, mainly their brightness/white-black values are f'd up
